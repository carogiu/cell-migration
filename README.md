# cell-migration
- MPhil in Engineering - University of Cambridge, Department of Engineering
- Modelling the migration of cells (wound healing, tumor growth)

## Packages and environments
- Needs to be run in the Fenics Projet environment
- Run the project in a Docker container as exlpained in the Fenics web page
- Requires Numpy, Matplotlib, Scipy, OS, CSV, Pylab

## Construction

- Run main.py to run the simulation
- Run extract_results to extract data from the results (need to put the names of the files to analyze in simu=[] at the bottom)

*In model*:

   - model_parameters_class and save_param take the input the parameters and same them in a txt file
   
   - model_domains creates the domain and boundaries
   
   - model_flow and model_phase contain the function to solve the model (the phase field and the flow are solved separately here)
   - model_common contains common functions to initiate and solve the problem over time
   
   - unique_solver can be used alternatively of model_flow and model_phase (the phae field and the flow are solved together here)
   
   - main extracts the parameters and solves the problem with them
   
   - model_save_evolution saves the results in HDF5 files
   
   - model_visu NOT USED ANYMORE

*In results*:

   - main_results extracts various fields from the results (velocity, pressure,  phase, orientation, vortexes...), creates figures and generates csv files
   - Interface velocity.ipynb is used the analyze the interface over time from csv files generated by main_results
   - Vortex analysis is used to analyze vortexes and other results from csv files generated by main_results
